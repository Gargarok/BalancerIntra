Only one thing to know for now : the development key is currently hidden within the RiotRequestSender. Its value has been *very savantly* encrypted, so that unready eyes are protected from it.
If you want the application to work correctly, you shall have to put your own key in there, I'm afraid. I suggest taking a look at the "DEV_KEY" String constant, within the RiotRequestSender's constants.
The team balancer main is the IntraBalance class, others are for my very personal convenience, thank you.

This will be a glorious README file, some day. For now though, it is nothing but a small, frail little atom within the huge universe of README files. 
... But glory shall come. Yes, little atom, glory shall come. And one day, you shall become huge.
